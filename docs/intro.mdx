# Getting Started

Welcome to **LearnVertexNova** — your journey into building a modern, multi-backend graphics renderer from the ground up.

This is not just another tutorial. This is a **hands-on learning experience** where every concept maps directly to working code, every lesson ends with something you can run, and every step builds toward a deep understanding of graphics engine architecture.

## What is VertexNova?

**VertexNova Engine** is a modern, multi-platform rendering and visualization engine designed for **learning, clarity, and long-term maintainability**. Unlike commercial game engines or high-level graphics libraries, VertexNova provides:

- **Transparent architecture** — See exactly how rendering works, from API calls to frame presentation
- **Multi-backend support** — Learn how to abstract across Vulkan, Metal, OpenGL, and WebGL with a unified API
- **Clean C++ design** — Modern C++17+ with strict ownership, predictable lifetimes, and clear abstractions
- **Educational focus** — Built to teach, not just to ship products

### Why not Unity, Unreal, or other engines?

**VertexNova is fundamentally different:**

| Aspect              | Unity/Unreal              | VertexNova                    |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Ship games quickly        | Learn engine architecture     |
| **Abstraction Level** | High-level, black-box   | Low-level, transparent        |
| **Code Visibility** | Mostly hidden             | Fully open and readable       |
| **Learning Value**  | Learn game design         | Learn graphics programming    |
| **Backend Control** | Limited                   | Full control over all backends |
| **Complexity**      | Millions of lines         | Focused, manageable codebase  |

**Why not other graphics libraries?**

- **GLFW/SDL**: Great for windowing, but you still need to write all rendering code yourself

- **bgfx/LLGL**: Excellent abstractions, but less educational — the magic is hidden

- **Raw Vulkan/Metal/OpenGL**: Too low-level, too much boilerplate, hard to learn

**VertexNova strikes the perfect balance**: enough abstraction to be practical, enough transparency to be educational, and enough structure to build real projects.

## What we're building

Over this learning journey, we'll construct a **production-quality renderer foundation** that works across multiple backends and platforms. This isn't about building "a single demo that happens to render" — it's about creating a **clean, maintainable foundation** you can grow into real projects.

### You'll learn to build

- **A consistent frame loop** — Master the update → render → present cycle that powers every real-time application
- **A portable resource model** — Design buffers, textures, and samplers that work seamlessly across Vulkan, Metal, and OpenGL
- **A robust shader workflow** — Implement naming conventions, reflection systems, and include mechanisms that scale
- **A clear API boundaries** — Separate engine API from backend implementation, making it easy to add new backends
- **A regression test suite** — Build demos that validate features and catch bugs automatically

### The learning philosophy

**Learn by building, not by reading.** Every concept in VertexNova is backed by:

- ✅ **Working code** you can compile and run
- ✅ **Clear examples** that demonstrate the concept
- ✅ **Cross-backend notes** showing how it differs per API
- ✅ **Real architecture** used in production engines

## What you need to know

### Essential Skills

- **Modern C++ (C++17+)** — We use contemporary C++ features, but we'll explain them as we go
- **CMake workflows** — Understanding how to build C++ projects is essential
- **Basic graphics concepts** — Familiarity with vertex buffers, shaders, and matrices helps, but we'll build the mental model together

### Nice to have

- Experience with any graphics API (OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, DirectX)
- Understanding of computer graphics fundamentals
- Previous engine or graphics programming experience

**Don't worry if you're new to graphics programming** — we'll explain concepts as we encounter them, and the codebase is designed to be readable and educational.

## Development environment

VertexNova is developed and battle-tested across multiple platforms:

- **Windows 11 / Windows 10** — Full support for Vulkan and OpenGL
- **Ubuntu 22.04** (Linux) — Vulkan and OpenGL with excellent tooling
- **macOS** — Native Metal support plus OpenGL and Vulkan (via MoltenVK)

### Recommended tooling

- **Qt Creator / VS Code** — Excellent for everyday development with great CMake integration
- **Xcode** — Essential for macOS debugging and GPU tools (Instruments, Metal debugger)
- **CMake 3.15+** — Our build system of choice

## Your first milestone

Let's get you up and running. In the next few minutes, you'll:

✅ **Build VertexNova** — Compile the engine from source  
✅ **Run your first demo** — See a triangle render on your screen  
✅ **Verify your toolchain** — Confirm everything is working correctly  
✅ **Establish your workflow** — Set up a repeatable daily development process  

This first milestone is crucial. Once you can build and run demos reliably, you have everything you need to start learning and experimenting.

## Quick start

<TabItem value="all" label="All Platforms" default>

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ajeetsinghyadav/vertexnova.git
cd vertexnova

# Initialize submodules (required dependencies)
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Configure and build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

# Using Visual Studio
git clone https://github.com/ajeetsinghyadav/vertexnova.git
cd vertexnova
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build . --config Release
```

**Expected time**: 5-15 minutes depending on your machine and internet connection.

### Step 2: Run your first demo

```bash
# After building, navigate to build directory
cd build

# Run a sample (exact path depends on your build configuration)
./bin/sample_02_triangle
# or
./bin/sample_04_cube
```

**What you should see**: A window opens with a rendered triangle or cube. Congratulations — you just ran your first VertexNova demo!

## Architecture overview

VertexNova is organized into clean, focused components:

- **xgl** — Multi-backend rendering layer providing a unified API across OpenGL, Metal, Vulkan, and WebGL
- **xwin** — Platform and window/input utilities abstracting OS-specific functionality
- **xviz** — Visualization helpers and utilities for common graphics tasks

This architecture is **intentionally simple**. Each component has a clear responsibility, making the codebase easy to understand, modify, and extend.

## Design philosophy

VertexNova follows a clear set of principles that guide every design decision:

- **Modern C++ with clarity over cleverness** — Readable code is more valuable than clever code
- **Thin abstractions and clear layering** — Enough abstraction to be practical, not so much that it's magic
- **Multi-backend design via unified API** — Learn once, run everywhere
- **Build to learn first; scale responsibly later** — Education and understanding come before optimization
