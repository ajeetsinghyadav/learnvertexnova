# Getting Started

Welcome to **LearnVertexNova** — a hands-on guide to building a modern, multi-backend renderer in C++.

Every chapter maps to working code, ends with something you can run, and steadily builds the engine foundations: **frame loop → resources → shaders → passes → presentation**.

By the end of this path, you'll not only run demos — you'll understand *why* they work and how to extend them.

## What is VertexNova?

**VertexNova Engine** is a modern, multi-platform rendering and visualization engine designed for **learning, clarity, and long-term maintainability**. Unlike commercial game engines or high-level graphics libraries, VertexNova provides:

- **Transparent architecture** — See exactly how rendering works, from API calls to frame presentation
- **Multi-backend support** — Learn how to abstract across Vulkan, Metal, OpenGL, and WebGL with a unified API
- **Clean C++ design** — Modern C++17+ with strict ownership, predictable lifetimes, and clear abstractions
- **Educational focus** — Built to teach, not just to ship products

### Why not Unity, Unreal, or other engines?

**VertexNova is fundamentally different:**

| Aspect              | Unity/Unreal              | VertexNova                    |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Ship games quickly        | Learn engine architecture     |
| **Abstraction Level** | High-level, black-box   | Low-level, transparent        |
| **Code Visibility** | Mostly hidden             | Fully open and readable       |
| **Learning Value**  | Learn game design         | Learn graphics programming    |
| **Backend Control** | Limited                   | Full control over all backends |
| **Complexity**      | Millions of lines         | Focused, manageable codebase  |

**Why not other graphics libraries?**

- **GLFW/SDL**: Great for windowing, but you still need to write all rendering code yourself

- **bgfx/LLGL**: Excellent abstractions, but less educational — the magic is hidden

- **Raw Vulkan/Metal/OpenGL**: Too low-level, too much boilerplate, hard to learn

**VertexNova strikes the perfect balance**: enough abstraction to be practical, enough transparency to be educational, and enough structure to build real projects.

## Core features

- 🧩 **Multi-backend mindset** — Vulkan, Metal, OpenGL (and Web later)
- 🧠 **Learn by building** — small demos that prove each concept
- 🛠️ **Engineer-friendly workflow** — CMake, debugging, and clean structure

## What you need to know

### Essential skills

- **Modern C++ (C++17+)** — We use contemporary C++ features, but we'll explain them as we go
- **CMake workflows** — Understanding how to build C++ projects is essential
- **Basic graphics concepts** — Familiarity with vertex buffers, shaders, and matrices helps, but we'll build the mental model together

### Nice to have

- Experience with any graphics API (OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, DirectX)
- Understanding of computer graphics fundamentals
- Previous engine or graphics programming experience

**Don't worry if you're new to graphics programming** — we'll explain concepts as we encounter them, and the codebase is designed to be readable and educational.

## Development environment

VertexNova is developed and battle-tested across multiple platforms:

- **Windows 11 / Windows 10** — Full support for Vulkan and OpenGL
- **Ubuntu 22.04** (Linux) — Vulkan and OpenGL with excellent tooling
- **macOS** — Native Metal support plus OpenGL and Vulkan (via MoltenVK)

### Recommended tooling

- **Qt Creator / VS Code** — Excellent for everyday development with great CMake integration
- **Xcode** — Essential for macOS debugging and GPU tools (Instruments, Metal debugger)
- **CMake 3.15+** — Our build system of choice

## Your first milestone

✅ **Build the engine**  
✅ **Run your first demo**  
✅ **Confirm your toolchain**  
✅ **Set up a repeatable workflow**

This first milestone is crucial. Once you can build and run demos reliably, you have everything you need to start learning and experimenting.

## Quick start

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="all" label="All Platforms" default>

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ajeetsinghyadav/vertexnova.git
cd vertexnova

# Initialize submodules (required dependencies)
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Configure and build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
# Using Visual Studio
git clone https://github.com/ajeetsinghyadav/vertexnova.git
cd vertexnova
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build . --config Release
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

```bash
# Using Xcode
git clone https://github.com/ajeetsinghyadav/vertexnova.git
cd vertexnova
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -G Xcode
cmake --build . --config Release
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```bash
# Using Unix Makefiles
git clone https://github.com/ajeetsinghyadav/vertexnova.git
cd vertexnova
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --config Release
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Expected time**: 5-15 minutes depending on your machine and internet connection.

### Run your first demo

```bash
# After building, navigate to build directory
cd build

# Run a sample (exact path depends on your build configuration)
./bin/sample_02_triangle
# or
./bin/sample_04_cube
```

**What you should see**: A window opens with a rendered triangle or cube. Congratulations — you just ran your first VertexNova demo!

See the [Demos](/docs/docs/demos) page for a complete list of available samples and what each demonstrates.

## Architecture overview

<figure>
  <img src="/img/diagrams/vertexnova_layers.png" alt="VertexNova architecture layers" />
  <figcaption>VertexNova layers: platform (xwin) + unified graphics API (xgl) + backend implementations.</figcaption>
</figure>

VertexNova is organized into clean, focused components:

- **xwin** — Platform and window/input utilities abstracting OS-specific functionality
- **xgl** — Multi-backend rendering layer providing a unified API across OpenGL, Metal, Vulkan, and WebGL
- **xviz** — Visualization helpers and utilities for common graphics tasks

This architecture is **intentionally simple**. Each component has a clear responsibility, making the codebase easy to understand, modify, and extend.

- **Thin abstractions and clear layering** — Enough abstraction to be practical, not so much that it's magic
- **Multi-backend design via unified API** — Learn once, run everywhere
- **Build to learn first; scale responsibly later** — Education and understanding come before optimization
