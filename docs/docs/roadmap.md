# Roadmap

This is intentionally **simple and honest**. Mark what is stable today, what is in progress, and what is next.

## Support matrix (starter)

| Feature | OpenGL | Vulkan | Metal | Web (WebGL) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Basic triangle/cube | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Textures | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| MSAA | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| Offscreen RenderTarget | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| ImGui overlay | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| Picking | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ |

> Tip: keep this table updated. It builds trust immediately.

## Next milestones (example)

- Stabilize the demo runner + one-command onboarding
- Add “Backend Playbooks” (Vulkan vs Metal vs GL differences)
- Add performance & debugging guides (validation, markers, captures)
