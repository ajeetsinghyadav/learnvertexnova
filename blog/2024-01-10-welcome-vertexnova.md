Welcome to **VertexNova Engine** - a modern, multi-platform rendering and visualization engine designed for clarity, portability, and steady evolution.

<!-- truncate -->

## What is VertexNova?

VertexNova Engine (VNE) is a personal learning project focused on building a clean, maintainable multi-backend rendering engine. The project provides:

- **Multi-backend rendering** - Unified API across OpenGL Desktop, OpenGL ES/WebGL, Metal, and Vulkan (WIP)
- **Cross-platform support** - macOS, iOS, Windows, Linux, and Web (Emscripten)
- **Modern C++ design** - Clean architecture with strict ownership and predictable lifetimes
- **Thin abstractions** - Clear layering with explicit control

## Why VertexNova?

This project started as a learning journey in computer graphics and engine architecture. After working on 3D visualization projects professionally, I wanted to build my own engine from the ground up, learning from excellent references like:

- [The Cherno's Game Engine Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT)
- [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)
- [libigl (facebook/igl)](https://github.com/facebook/igl)
- [LLGL](https://github.com/LukasBanana/LLGL)

## Current Status

- Simple demos run on macOS, iOS, OpenGL desktop, and Web (Emscripten/WebGL)
- Vulkan backend is in progress
- More demos and tests are being added to cover concepts thoroughly

## What's Next?

Check out the [Getting Started guide](/docs/intro) to begin learning with VertexNova, or explore the [Demos](/docs/docs/demos) to see what's currently working.

The project is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ajeetsinghyadav/vertexnova). Contributions, feedback, and questions are welcome!
